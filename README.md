# Time Series Forecasting for Stock Price Prediction

A comprehensive time series forecasting project to predict stock prices using historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, Volume) data.

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock price movements using time series forecasting techniques. The dataset contains daily stock price information including Open, High, Low, Close prices along with Adjusted Close and Volume data.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on stock price data
2. Implement multiple time series forecasting models
3. Compare model performance and accuracy
4. Generate future price predictions
5. Provide investment insights based on analysis

## üìÅ Dataset Information

The dataset contains daily stock price records with the following features:

### Attributes:
- **Date**: Trading date (format: MM/DD/YYYY)
- **Open**: Opening price of the stock
- **High**: Highest price during the trading day
- **Low**: Lowest price during the trading day
- **Close**: Closing price of the stock
- **Adj Close**: Adjusted closing price (accounting for corporate actions)
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Time Series Analysis**: Statsmodels, Pandas
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Forecasting Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, Prophet

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

### Time Series Analysis:
- **Price Trends**: Visualizing Open, High, Low, Close patterns
- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume patterns and correlations
- **Volatility Analysis**: Price movement and stability
- **Seasonality**: Daily, weekly, monthly patterns
- **Autocorrelation**: ACF and PACF analysis

### Statistical Analysis:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, std deviation
- **Distribution Analysis**: Price and volume distributions
- **Correlation Analysis**: Between different price metrics
- **Stationarity Testing**: ADF test, KPSS test

## ü§ñ Forecasting Models

### Statistical Models:
1. **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
2. **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

### Point Forecast Metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **Symmetric MAPE (sMAPE)**

### Probabilistic Forecast Metrics:
- **Coverage Probability**
- **Pinball Loss**
- **Quantile Score**


## üìà Visualization Strategy

### Time Series Plots:
- **Price Charts**: OHLC candlestick charts
- **Volume Charts**: Trading volume with price overlay
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Forecast vs Actual**: Model performance visualization

### Diagnostic Plots:
- **Residual Analysis**: Model error patterns
- **ACF/PACF**: Autocorrelation analysis
- **QQ-Plots**: Normality testing
- **Learning Curves**: Model training progress

### Forecast Visualization:
- **Confidence Intervals**: Prediction uncertainty
- **Multiple Horizon Forecasts**: Short vs long-term predictions
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side performance

## üíº Financial Applications

1. **Investment Strategy**: Buy/sell/hold recommendations
2. **Risk Management**: Volatility and drawdown analysis
3. **Portfolio Optimization**: Asset allocation based on predictions
4. **Algorithmic Trading**: Automated trading signals
5. **Hedging Strategies**: Risk mitigation approaches

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Data Frequency:
- **Daily data**: Suitable for most models
- **Intraday data**: Requires different approach
- **Missing days**: Handle holidays and non-trading days

### Market Regimes:
- **Bull markets**: Upward trends
- **Bear markets**: Downward trends
- **Sideways markets**: Range-bound trading

### External Factors:
- **Economic indicators**: Interest rates, GDP, inflation
- **Company news**: Earnings reports, mergers
- **Market sentiment**: Investor psychology
